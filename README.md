# RegressionMLModels
In this repository, you can find our implementations (from scratch) of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, both adapted for binary and multiple classification purposes. We also provide a link to the colab where we run the experiments, and write other code for data preprocessing and experimanetal purposes.
